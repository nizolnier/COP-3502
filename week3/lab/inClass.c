    PUT A SUMMARY OF THE PURPOSE OF THE CODE (just a few lines will do and DO
   NOT EXCEED 100 char Per line for clarity)

    My Own As Sample:

    => read a set of students data and their grading information from a file and
   then process them and then write the requested data to another file.
